I've finally had time to run Civ4 under a debugger to figure out why straight forward decompression of save game data 
isn't working. 
For those who are interested, details follow:

When writing compressed data to a save game file, Civ4 writes the data in chunks. The size of the compressed data chunk
is written first, followed by the compressed data itself. Each chunk is usually 64K in size, except for the last chunk.
Following the last chunk, a terminator size of 0 is written.

For example, let's say that compressed data for a game consists of 2 full 64K chunks and a last chunk of size F29D. The save
game file starting at where compressed data is written would look something like this (actual data values of course depend
on the game itself; also the initial offset into the save game will vary from game to game):
Code:
Offset            Size            Data            Remarks
0x00000B35        00 00 10 00     78 9C E4 BD     Note the 78 9C zlib magic at the start of the data.
0x00010B39        00 00 10 00     6D 72 3E CC     Offset is B35 + 64K + 4 bytes for the size field.
0x00020B3D        9D F2 00 00     F6 9B 63 8E     Offset is 10B39 + 64K + 4 bytes for the size field.

Change log:
9/4/2024 - Change to reflect that first compressed chunk isn't always 64K in length. For Lock Modified Assets games, 
the first chuck is (sometimes? or perhaps always?) shorter.
